In 2001, Ray Bradbury [gave a speech at](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W-r7ABrMYU) (video starts around 11:00) the University of California where he encouraged young writers to read three things every night:

1. One short story ([Dahl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Dahl), [Hemingway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemingway), [Matheson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Matheson), [Cheever](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cheever), [Kneale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Kneale), [Collier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Collier_(writer)), [Warton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Wharton), [Irving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Irving))
2. One poem ([Shakespeare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare), [Frost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frost), [Pope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Pope))
3. One essay ([Huxley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus_Huxley), [Eiseley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Eiseley))

His goal is to make you into a collector of the metaphor -- filling your head with thoughts, theories, and ideas before bed, rather than completing another level in Angry Birds.

This repository is to help me 1.) follow Bradbury's advice and 2.) create a list of reading material to fill 1,000 nights.
