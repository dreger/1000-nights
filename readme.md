### Goals
1. To collect enough great literature to allow for the reading of one short story, poem, and essay each night for 1,000 nights.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Read the readme.md in whichever folder you want to submit a piece (short stories / poems / essays)
3. Check the [resources.md](resources.md) file to get a list of sites we've collected that need scoured!

## About
In 2001, Ray Bradbury [gave a speech at](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W-r7ABrMYU) (video starts around 11:00) the University of California where he encouraged young writers to read three things every night:

1. One short story ([Dahl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Dahl), [Hemingway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemingway), [Matheson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Matheson), [Cheever](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cheever), [Kneale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Kneale), [Collier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Collier_%28writer%29), [Warton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Wharton), [Irving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Irving))
2. One poem ([Shakespeare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare), [Frost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frost), [Pope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Pope))
3. One essay ([Huxley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus_Huxley), [Eiseley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Eiseley))

His goal is to make you into a collector of the metaphor -- filling your head with thoughts, theories, and ideas before bed, rather than completing another level in Angry Birds.

This repository is to help me 1.) follow Bradbury's advice and 2.) create a list of reading material to fill 1,000 nights.
